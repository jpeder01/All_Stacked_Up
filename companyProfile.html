      <h3>Sean Spraungel</h3>

      <p>Sean Spraungel's background in Masonry dates back 6 generations. Sean's Great-Great-
      Great-Great Grandfather was an expert mason and his knowledge was not only passed down 
      from generation to generation but it has grown into what is now Sean's company -- All 
      Stacked Up Masonry, Inc.  To say there is experience within his company would be an 
      understatement. Masonry has been the foundation of the Spraungel family and is a trade they 
      take great pride in.  Sean formally started  All Stacked Up Masonry, Inc"  in 2001 and has 
      worked on hundreds of projects, big and small since then.  Sean understands the value of 
      safety and craftsmanship.  We will cut no corners to ensure the job is done right and meets 
      your standards and expectations.</p>

      years ago and moved on to work for a large commercial general contractor as a superintendent, 
      Project Manager, Estimator and finally a Construction Manager for over 17 years.  Rick chose to bring 
      his experience to the All Stacked Up Team in 2015.  He has dedicated his time as Operations Manager 
      to implementing new safety and quality control programs along with Project Management to bring a 
      high level of service to all of our owners and contractor’s needs.</p>
